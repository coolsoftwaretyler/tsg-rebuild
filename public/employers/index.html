    <p class="text-center" style="font-size:20px;">Advertising, recruiting, sorting through hundreds of applications to select a few candidates for interviews, and selecting the best fit for your company; it takes away time and attention you’d be better off spending on other parts of your business.
      And in the cannabis industry, the process is made even more difficult by the limited number of experienced candidates and the complex regulations and required background checks. By working with our firm, you’ll not only save time and effort, you
      can also rest assured that you will be presented with highly qualified, skilled and motivated candidates. We are dedicated to providing you with the exceptional candidates you need for your company to thrive and grow.</p>

    <p>Diversity is far more than just a moral issue. It’s a business necessity for any company in the 21st century — especially for cannabis businesses, which face opportunities and challenges unlike any other industry. It’s no secret that the medical and
      legal cannabis industries are highly scrutinized. This scrutiny extends to the diversity of the staff of prospective businesses. Several of the most recent states to create a competitive cannabis dispensary application process have requested information
      about the diversity of the applicants.</p>
    <p>
      We will help you find candidates that are aware of and sensitive to the diversity among your customers and stakeholders. With our help, you can build your brand as one of the rare cannabis businesses to connect across communities.
    </p>
    <p>And most importantly, you will find that by bringing together a team with different backgrounds, your workforce will be well equipped to creatively and effectively handle the unpredictable nature of the cannabis business.</p>

            really finding my passion but only paying the bills.   My new career gave my life direction and purpose. For the first time I not only knew what I wanted to do with my life, but Shaleen had showed me how to make it happen.  She opened my eyes
            to an entire professional world in drug policy reform that I had not even known existed before.  But more than this, through her exceptional mentorship, she helped me navigate these new waters and guided me to the place I am today.  I get
            to wake up every morning and work at a job in which I absolutely believe and love.  I will be forever grateful to Shaleen for my new career and many of the friends whom I’ve met along the way.</p><br>

            a job, and I found myself working to regulate marijuana in Colorado. Through my work I had the chance to do some videos for the A64 campaign, which inspired me to pursue video work as a career. Shaleen even had a hand in the social media launch
            of my company. She and another activist had a viral video idea commenting on the 2012 Obama campaign commerical and asked if I'd help produce it. Some quick thinking, mixed with Shaleen's will and determination, and we created a video that
            conveyed a message and spread quickly. It was the first video we posted, and at 61,995 views, it is our most-viewed video to date.</p><br>

            mind, and reminds us that this isn't a movement only "by and about" white men. And personally, without her advice, I would have never been able to "come out" to my pretty traditional Chinese family about a cause I am passionate about.</p><br>

            <p class="testimonial_para">Jimi Devine came aboard our award-winning podcast The Hash as a truly plugged-in and qualified sale representative. But his real passion has been writing, and since then I've seen him blossom at Cannabis Now, San Francisco Chronicle, and High Times. It's because of THC Staffing that I've made not only an excellent colleague, but a lifelong friend. Danielle and her team is world-class.</p><br>
