    <h1 style="text-align: left;">Our Story</h1>
    <p>THC Staffing Group is an organization dedicated to closing the gap between America’s rapidly growing cannabis industry and diverse, qualified employment candidates. The organization was founded by best friends and seasoned activists, Shaleen Title
      and Danielle Schumacher, when they combined their dedication to smart drug policy with their desire to foster the development of a fair, robust and legal cannabis industry.</p>
    <p>After meeting as roommates, Shaleen & Danielle realized they shared a similar vision of ending the drug war and legalizing cannabis. They co-founded the University of Illinois chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy before going on to serve as
      activists in the industry. After her appointment to the Massachusetts newly formed Cannabis Control Commission, Shaleen Title left THC Staffing Group in 2017. Danielle continues as President & CEO and will continue THC Staffing Group’s mission of
      connecting diverse cross-sections of America’s population with employment opportunities in the industry.</p>

        Fabiola’s experiences as an activist and public health researcher paved her way into the cannabis industry. Her expertise lies in adding a health lens to issues of immigration, incarceration, education, and economic security. Her research and advocacy
        work has helped pass laws that improved health and equity of low-wage workers (SB 588 – California Fair Day’s Pay Act) and people in the criminal justice system (Proposition 57 – Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act). Many of the projects she
        worked on were with people who’ve been disproportionately criminalized by cannabis prohibition. She has also experienced how the war on drugs affected her family and communities. As a result, she decided to focus on the cannabis industry and started
        her career shift by interning with THC Staffing Group. She believes that the cannabis industry can improve individual health and economic wellness. Fabiola received her Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Master’s degree in Public Health from the
        University of California Los Angeles.</p>
