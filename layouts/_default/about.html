      <h1 class="text-left">Our Story</h1>
      <p>THC Staffing Group(R) is an organization dedicated to closing the gap between America’s rapidly growing
        cannabis industry and diverse, qualified employment candidates. The organization was founded by best friends and
        seasoned activists, Shaleen Title
        and Danielle Schumacher, when they combined their dedication to smart drug policy with their desire to foster
        the development of a fair, robust and legal cannabis industry.</p>
      <p>After meeting as roommates, Shaleen and Danielle realized they shared a similar vision of ending the drug war
        and legalizing cannabis. They co-founded the University of Illinois chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy
        before going on to serve as
        activists in the industry. After her appointment to the Massachusetts newly formed Cannabis Control Commission,
        Shaleen Title left THC Staffing Group in 2017. Danielle continues as President & CEO and will continue THC
        Staffing Group’s mission of
        connecting diverse cross-sections of America’s population with employment opportunities in the industry.</p>
