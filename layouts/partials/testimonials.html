          <p class="testimonial_para">I had become very frustrated with the job application process and was unhappy with a mundane entry-level position found through a general staffing agency after graduating college. I reached out to Shaleen Title and she connected me with the
            position I’ve held for the last year working at the nation’s premiere marijuana law firm in Denver, CO. Without Shaleen’s efforts I would not be waking up every morning excited to go to work. This job has changed my life and Shaleen was responsible
            for making that happen! I can’t thank you enough!</p><br>

          <p class="testimonial_para">Danielle Schumacher is a talented, capable and hard-working individual with deep roots in the cannabis community. She has been an activist, an employee and a manager for numerous groups over the years, and I have had the opportunity to work
            with her directly. She has a broad understanding of the issues and many links into the community based upon, among other things, her work with Oaksterdam University and the offices of physicians, attorneys and cannabis experts including myself.
            She is organized, efficient and a problem solver. It is my honor to recommend her services, and I have no doubt that those who take advantage of her offerings will be pleased with the services and results that they receive.</p><br>

          <p class="testimonial_para">When Shaleen recruited me to volunteer for the non-profit Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, it changed my life. That was about five years ago and now I am a full time staff member.  Before then, I had bounced around from job to job, never
            really finding my passion but only paying the bills.   My new career gave my life direction and purpose. For the first time I not only knew what I wanted to do with my life, but Shaleen had showed me how to make it happen.  She opened my eyes
            to an entire professional world in drug policy reform that I had not even known existed before.  But more than this, through her exceptional mentorship, she helped me navigate these new waters and guided me to the place I am today.  I get
            to wake up every morning and work at a job in which I absolutely believe and love.  I will be forever grateful to Shaleen for my new career and many of the friends whom I’ve met along the way.</p><br>

          <p class="testimonial_para">Shaleen helped get me started working in drug policy reform by offering me a job at LEAP not long after I was out of college. When I moved to Colorado in 2012, she recruited me to volunteer with the Amendment 64 campaign. Volunteering became
            a job, and I found myself working to regulate marijuana in Colorado. Through my work I had the chance to do some videos for the A64 campaign, which inspired me to pursue video work as a career. Shaleen even had a hand in the social media launch
            of my company. She and another activist had a viral video idea commenting on the 2012 Obama campaign commerical and asked if I'd help produce it. Some quick thinking, mixed with Shaleen's will and determination, and we created a video that
            conveyed a message and spread quickly. It was the first video we posted, and at 61,995 views, it is our most-viewed video to date.</p><br>

          <p class="testimonial_para">There are still so few women involved in the legalization movement, and even fewer women of color. Shaleen is an absolute inspiration and a necessary role model for other young female activists. She teaches us to never be afraid to speak our
            mind, and reminds us that this isn't a movement only "by and about" white men. And personally, without her advice, I would have never been able to "come out" to my pretty traditional Chinese family about a cause I am passionate about.</p><br>

            ability to adapt in this quickly evolving industry.  We reached out to Shaleen and THC Staffing Group in hopes they could make that search a little easier for us.  They located someone they believed was a good fit for our culture and needs
            and we hired Jonathan in less than a week.  Not only has Jonathan met those high expectations after his hire, he has exceeded them and is already rising in the ranks.  I know we’ll be going back to Shaleen and her team in the future, not only
            for our Denver business, but for those of our clients around the country.</p><br>
