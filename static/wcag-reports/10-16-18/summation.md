## Check 301: The contrast between the colour of text and its background for the element is not sufficient to meet WCAG2.0 Level AA.

The contrast color for the lead text on the Cannabis Newbie Guide quote is not
a high enough contrast for AA compliance. We need to increase the contrast.

## Check 117: i (italic) element used.

This isn't an italic element, but rather an icon tag, and isn't prohibited as
a semantic element.

## Check 37: Header nesting - header following h1 is incorrect.

This is not a correct parsing, the header in question is an h1 following only h1s.
